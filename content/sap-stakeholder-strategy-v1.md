Subject: UW Research Collaboration: Independent Benchmarking of SAP RPT-1

Dear Dr. Sun,

I am reaching out on behalf of a University of Washington MSIM team proposing an independent, academic-quality benchmarking study of SAP RPT-1 (ConTextTab) against state-of-the-art tabular AI models.

Given your UW affiliate faculty role and leadership of SAP AI Foundation, we believe this collaboration offers mutual value:
- For SAP: Third-party validation from top-tier research institution, competitive intelligence, use case guidance
- For UW: Publication-quality research suitable for NeurIPS/ICML 2026, open-source contribution

Our proposed study evaluates RPT-1 against TabPFN v2.5, TabICL, AutoGluon, and traditional ML across 71 datasets with rigorous statistical testing (Friedman, Nemenyi). We aim to provide transparent, reproducible findings that benefit both SAP and the academic community.

Would you be open to a 30-minute informational meeting to discuss potential collaboration? I've attached a 1-page summary and full proposal (PDF) for your review.

Best regards,
Rahil M. Harihar
Project Lead, UW MSIM

**Template 2: Technical Outreach to Sam Thelin**

```
Subject: Request for Technical Guidance: Independent RPT-1 Benchmarking Study

Dear Sam,

I recently read your NeurIPS 2025 paper "ConTextTab: A Semantics-Aware Tabular In-Context Learner" with great interest. The relational foundation model approach is compelling, and we'd like to conduct an independent academic benchmarking study to validate and extend your findings.

Our UW MSIM team proposes evaluating SAP RPT-1-OSS against TabPFN v2.5, TabICL, AutoGluon, and traditional ML across 71 TabArena/TabZilla datasets. We're committed to rigorous methodology (Friedman tests, 10-fold CV, Docker reproducibility) suitable for NeurIPS/ICML 2026 submission.

I'm reaching out to request your technical guidance on:
1. Optimal RPT-1 configuration for fair comparison
2. Feedback on our experimental protocol (attached methodology section)
3. Potential co-authorship opportunity (if SAP interested)

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss? We aim to provide transparent, credible findings that benefit both SAP and the research community.

Best regards,
Rahil M. Harihar

- "We thank SAP AI Foundation for technical discussions and support."

---

### Data Sharing & Transparency

**Public Data Only**:
- All 71 datasets sourced from TabArena, TabZilla, OpenML (public repositories)
- No proprietary SAP data required or requested

**Results Transparency**:
- **Commitment**: Report all findings transparently, including negative results
- **SAP Review**: Provide SAP 1-week review window before public release (courtesy, not veto)
- **Academic Integrity**: UW team retains final publication decision (no SAP censorship)

**Open Source**:
- GitHub repository public from Week 4 (proposal phase)
- Code, Docker containers, results fully reproducible

---

### Publication Strategy

**Target**: NeurIPS 2026 (May submission) or ICML 2026 (January submission)

**Pre-Print**:
- Post to arXiv immediately after conference submission (standard practice)
- SAP can reference arXiv version in marketing materials pending peer review

**Press & Media**:
- Coordinate with SAP communications team on joint press release (if desired)
- UW and SAP co-promote publication through respective channels

**Follow-On Work**:
- Encourage follow-on research by broader community
- SAP can cite independent validation in future RPT papers

---

## Risk Management

### Risk: SAP Non-Responsive

**Mitigation**:
- Multi-channel outreach (email, LinkedIn, UW faculty introduction)
- Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 stakeholders (diversified engagement)

**Contingency**:
- Proceed with independent benchmarking (still valuable for academic community)
- Document outreach attempts in paper acknowledgments

---

### Risk: SAP Concerned About Negative Findings

**Mitigation**:
- Frame as "optimization opportunities" not criticisms
- Emphasize use case guidance (where RPT-1 excels vs underperforms)
- Transparent communication early (Week 7 check-in shares preliminary trends)

**Contingency**:
- Academic integrity commitment: publish findings regardless
- Offer SAP response/rebuttal section in paper (if desired)

---

### Risk: Co-Authorship Disagreements

**Mitigation**:
- Define contribution criteria upfront (Week 5 discussion)
- Document agreements in writing (email confirmation)

**Contingency**:
- Proceed with UW-only authorship if agreement not reached
- Acknowledge SAP contributions in acknowledgments section

---

### Risk: Timeline Delays

**Mitigation**:
- Built-in buffer in Week 10 for re-runs
- Weekly progress updates maintain accountability

**Contingency**:
- If experiments delayed, prioritize subset of datasets for initial paper
- Submit to ICML 2026 instead of NeurIPS if more time needed

---

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Success

✅ **Tier 1 Contact Established**: At least 1 substantive conversation with Walter Sun, Sam Thelin, or Johannes Hoffart

✅ **Technical Collaboration**: SAP provides RPT-1 configuration guidance or methodology feedback

✅ **Co-Authorship Opportunity**: SAP researchers commit to co-authorship OR acknowledge collaboration

✅ **Results Preview**: SAP stakeholders attend Week 10 results presentation

### Long-Term Relationship

✅ **Ongoing Partnership**: SAP expresses interest in future research collaborations (RPT-2, domain-specific studies)

✅ **Talent Pipeline**: SAP discusses internship/recruiting opportunities with UW team

✅ **Academic Network**: SAP introduces UW team to broader academic partners

---

## Conclusion

This stakeholder engagement strategy prioritizes **transparency, mutual benefit, and scientific rigor**. By approaching SAP AI Foundation as academic peers (not vendors or clients), we establish a collaborative relationship that benefits both UW (publication-quality research) and SAP (independent validation, competitive intelligence, academic credibility).

**Key Principles**:
1. **Respect**: Acknowledge SAP's expertise and intellectual contributions
2. **Transparency**: Share findings openly, including limitations and negative results
3. **Collaboration**: Frame as partnership, not audit
4. **Academic Integrity**: Maintain independence while valuing SAP input

**Next Step**: Execute Week 3 outreach to Walter Sun following template above.
