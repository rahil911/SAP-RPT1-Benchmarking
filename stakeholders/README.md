Subject: UW MSIM Research Project - SAP RPT-1 Benchmarking Study

Dear [First Name],

I'm reaching out as the lead of a University of Washington MSIM capstone team conducting an independent, academic-quality benchmarking study of SAP RPT-1 and tabular foundation models.

Our team of four graduate students (with combined 14+ years of industry experience at companies like SAP, AWS, Morgan Stanley, and Rocket Mortgage) is designing a rigorous, publication-targeted comparison of SAP RPT-1 against TabPFN, TabICL, AutoGluon, and traditional ML baselines across 70+ datasets.

We're planning to submit our findings to NeurIPS/ICML 2026 and believe this independent validation could provide valuable insights for SAP's RPT-1 positioning and roadmap.

I'd love to share more details about our methodology and explore potential collaboration opportunities. Would you be open to a brief conversation in the coming weeks?

Best regards,
Rahil M. Harihar
University of Washington, MSIM

Subject: [PROPOSAL] UW MSIM - SAP RPT-1 Benchmarking Study

Dear [First Name],

Following up on my earlier note, I'm excited to share our complete research proposal for the SAP RPT-1 benchmarking study.

Attached is our comprehensive proposal (PDF), which outlines:
- Independent benchmarking methodology (70+ datasets, 7 models, publication-quality statistical rigor)
- Team qualifications (4 UW MSIM students, 94-86% match scores for this project)
- 12-week execution timeline with compute resource strategy
- Expected outcomes and value for SAP (competitive positioning, use case guidance)

We're confident this study will provide valuable, unbiased validation of SAP RPT-1's capabilities and help identify areas for optimization or positioning.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss this further and explore how we might collaborate.

Interactive project portal: [Link to web portal]
GitHub repository: [Link when available]

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
