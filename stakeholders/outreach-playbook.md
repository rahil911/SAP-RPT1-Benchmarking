## EMAIL TEMPLATES

### PHASE 1: INITIAL INTRODUCTION (WEEK 3)

---

#### Template 1A: Walter Sun (UW Connection, Executive)

**Subject**: UW MSIM Research: Independent RPT-1 Benchmarking Study

---

Dear Dr. Sun,

I'm reaching out as a UW MSIM student proposing an independent academic benchmarking study of SAP-RPT-1 as our capstone project.

**Why this matters to SAP:**
As a UW affiliate faculty member, you understand the value of third-party validation. Our publication-quality research will provide:
- Independent credibility you can cite to technical buyers
- Identification of RPT-1's competitive advantages and optimal use cases
- Academic visibility for SAP's tabular foundation model work

**Our team:**
4 UW MSIM students with 14+ years combined Fortune 500 experience (AI/ML, product management, data engineering, analytics). Timeline: 20 weeks, ending May 2026.

**My ask:**
30 minutes to discuss RPT-1's vision and get your guidance on evaluation criteria. We'll share findings with you pre-publication for feedback.

Would you be open to a brief call week of [DATE]?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
UW MSIM Candidate 2026
[LinkedIn Profile]
[Email]

---

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Leverages UW connection (his affiliate faculty role)
- ✅ Leads with value to SAP, not student needs
- ✅ Concise (under 150 words)
- ✅ Specific, low-friction ask (30 minutes)
- ✅ Demonstrates preparation (knows his role, timeline)

---

#### Template 1B: Sam Thelin (Technical Lead, Researcher)

**Subject**: Academic Research: Independent Benchmarking of ConTextTab/SAP-RPT-1

---

Dear Sam,

I'm a UW MSIM student researching tabular foundation models for my capstone project. I read your ConTextTab paper (NeurIPS 2025) with great interest - the semantics-aware approach is compelling.

**Proposed research:**
Independent academic benchmarking of RPT-1 alongside established tabular ML baselines. Our goal: validate your research claims, identify optimal use cases, and contribute to the tabular ML community.

**Value to you:**
- Citation of ConTextTab paper in our publication
- Independent validation of research claims through rigorous replication
- Constructive feedback on edge cases and failure modes
- Connection to UW's ML research community

**Background:**
Our team has ML engineering (LLMs, RAG, PyTorch), data engineering (PySpark, big data), and product expertise. We're aiming for publication-quality rigor, not just a student report.

**My ask:**
30 minutes to discuss ConTextTab's architecture and get your feedback on evaluation methodology.

Would you be open to a technical discussion week of [DATE]?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
UW MSIM Candidate 2026
[LinkedIn Profile] | [GitHub]
[Email]

---

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Shows you read the paper (specific mention of "semantics-aware")
- ✅ Researcher-to-researcher tone (not vendor-customer)
- ✅ Citation incentive (benefits him directly as co-author)
- ✅ Demonstrates technical credibility (team background)
- ✅ Respectful ask (30 min, specific date window)

**Note**: Verify Sam's current employment before sending. If he's left SAP, adjust framing to focus on published ConTextTab research only.

---

#### Template 1C: Dr. Johannes Hoffart (Strategic, CTO-level)

**Subject**: UW Research Proposal: Independent Benchmarking of SAP-RPT-1

---

Dear Dr. Hoffart,

I'm proposing an independent academic benchmarking study of SAP-RPT-1 as our UW MSIM capstone project, and I'd value your strategic guidance.

**Why this matters to SAP's AI strategy:**
Third-party validation from a top-tier university provides credibility that internal benchmarks cannot:
- Technical buyers trust academic research over vendor claims
- Competitive differentiation: "University of Washington validated our approach"
- Product roadmap insights: We'll identify strengths to amplify and gaps to address

**Our approach:**
Publication-quality methodology, fair comparison against baselines, focus on real-world enterprise use cases. We'll use the publicly available sap-rpt-1-oss model to ensure independence.

**Background:**
Our team combines ML engineering, data pipelines, and product management expertise. Timeline: 20 weeks, ending May 2026 (aligns with your Q2-Q3 planning).

**My ask:**
30 minutes to discuss RPT-1's vision and get your input on business-relevant evaluation criteria. We'll share findings with SAP pre-publication for feedback.

Would you be open to a strategic discussion week of [DATE]?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
UW MSIM Candidate 2026
[LinkedIn Profile]
[Email]

---

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Strategic framing (not just technical)
- ✅ CTO-level language (business value, competitive differentiation)
- ✅ Risk-mitigated (using public model, sharing pre-publication)
- ✅ Timeline alignment (Q2-Q3 planning)
- ✅ Specific, actionable ask

## TIMING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Best Days to Send Email

**Best**:
- ✅ **Tuesday** (inbox cleared from Monday, not yet end-of-week chaos)
- ✅ **Wednesday** (mid-week, focused work time)
- ✅ **Thursday** (still motivated, planning next week)

**Okay**:
- ⚠️ **Monday** (inbox overload risk, but some people clear email Monday morning)

**Avoid**:
- ❌ **Friday afternoon** (weekend mode, low response rate)
- ❌ **Weekends** (unprofessional, likely ignored)
- ❌ **Holidays** (obvious)

---

### Best Times to Send Email

**For US-based contacts** (Walter Sun):
- ✅ **9-11 AM Pacific** (fresh inbox, morning focus)
- ⚠️ **2-4 PM Pacific** (afternoon lull, less ideal)

**For Europe-based contacts** (Most SAP AI team):
- ✅ **9-11 AM CET** (= 12-2 AM Pacific - use email scheduling!)
- ✅ **2-4 PM CET** (= 5-7 AM Pacific - schedule for their afternoon)

**Pro Tip**: Use email scheduling (Gmail: "Schedule send") to land in their inbox at optimal time in their timezone.

---

### Response Time Expectations

**Tier 1 Executives** (Walter Sun, Johannes Hoffart):
- **Expected**: 7-14 days (very busy)
- **Follow-Up**: After 10 days
- **Give Up**: After 2 attempts + LinkedIn (3 weeks total)

**Tier 2 Researchers** (Sam Thelin, Marco Spinaci):
- **Expected**: 3-7 days (researchers usually responsive)
- **Follow-Up**: After 7 days
- **Give Up**: After 2 attempts (2 weeks total)

**Tier 3 Supporting** (Others):
- **Expected**: 5-10 days
- **Follow-Up**: After 7 days
- **Give Up**: After 1 follow-up (if low priority)

---

### Calendar Blocks to Avoid

**Conference Weeks** (Don't contact right before or during):
- NeurIPS (December 2025)
- ICML (July - but outside our timeline)
- Major SAP events (SAP TechEd already passed Nov 2025)

**Holiday Periods** (Reduced response rates):
- Late December (Christmas/New Year)
- Late March/Early April (Easter - Europe)
- August (Europe vacation month)

**Fiscal Calendar** (SAP):
- Quarter-end: Avoid last 2 weeks of March, June, Sept, Dec
- Annual planning: Avoid late January (FY planning)

3. How many meetings scheduled?
4. How many meetings completed? (What were key takeaways?)
5. Any referrals to other stakeholders?
6. What's working? (Which templates, which timing, which value props?)
7. What's not working? (Low response from certain tier? Adjust strategy)
8. Next week's plan: Who to contact, who to follow up with?

---

---

## FALLBACK PLANS

### Scenario: No Tier 1 Responses After 3 Weeks

**Options**:
1. **Pivot to Tier 2/3**: Engage researchers directly (Sam Thelin path less critical if can access Marco Spinaci or Maximilian Schambach)
2. **Organic Research**: Proceed with publicly available sap-rpt-1-oss model, no SAP collaboration required
3. **Leverage Walter Sun's UW Connection**: Reach out through UW faculty network (if you have connections)
4. **SAP University Alliances**: Contact program directly (see organizational structure doc)
5. **Conference Networking**: If NeurIPS or other conference, approach in person (more effective than cold email)

---

### Scenario: Legal/Compliance Barriers

**If SAP Legal Blocks Collaboration**:
1. **Public Model Only**: Use sap-rpt-1-oss (Hugging Face), cite GitHub repo, no SAP internal access needed
2. **Academic Freedom**: Frame as independent research (no SAP collaboration required, just studying public model)
3. **Publication Path**: Proceed as pure academic research, publish without SAP review (standard academic practice)

**Communication**:
> "We understand the legal considerations. To keep this simple, we'll proceed with the publicly available sap-rpt-1-oss model as an independent academic study. We'll still cite ConTextTab and SAP's research appropriately. Thanks for considering our proposal!"

---

### Scenario: Stakeholders Want Co-Authorship

**If SAP Researchers Request Co-Authorship**:

**Assess**:
- Did they contribute intellectually to methodology/findings? → Co-authorship appropriate
- Did they just provide access or answer questions? → Acknowledgment only

**Response**:
> "We'd be thrilled to explore co-authorship if there's substantial intellectual contribution to the research design and findings. Let's discuss what that collaboration would look like.
>
> At minimum, we'll acknowledge SAP's support and cite your ConTextTab work extensively. Would co-authorship require legal review on SAP's side?"

**Caution**:
- Co-authorship may slow publication (SAP legal review)
- May compromise independence perception
- Only agree if genuine intellectual contribution

---

### Scenario: Overwhelmingly Positive Response

**If Multiple Tier 1 Stakeholders Engage**:

**Priority**:
1. **Walter Sun** (executive authority, UW connection) → Primary relationship
2. **Sam Thelin** or **Marco Spinaci** (technical depth) → Technical advisor
3. **Johannes Hoffart** (strategic vision) → Strategic advisor

**Manage Bandwidth**:
- Don't over-commit (you have capstone workload)
- Set expectations: "We'll provide monthly updates rather than weekly"
- Delegate: Different team members own different stakeholder relationships
  - Example: Rahil → Walter Sun (product/strategy)
  - Siddarth → Sam Thelin (technical/ML)
  - Mathew → Data engineering questions
  - Shreyas → Business use cases

## COMMUNICATION BEST PRACTICES

### Email Etiquette

**Structure**:
1. **Subject Line**: Clear, specific, under 60 characters
   - ✅ "UW Research: SAP-RPT-1 Benchmarking"
   - ❌ "Quick question"
2. **Greeting**: Professional but warm
   - ✅ "Hi [First Name]," or "Dear Dr. [Last Name],"
   - ❌ "Hey!" (too casual)
3. **Opening**: One sentence context
   - ✅ "I'm a UW MSIM student proposing..."
4. **Body**: 3-5 short paragraphs (under 200 words total)
   - Why this matters (to them)
   - What we're proposing
   - What we're asking
5. **Closing**: Clear call-to-action
   - ✅ "Would you be open to a 30-min call week of [DATE]?"
   - ❌ "Let me know what you think" (too vague)
6. **Signature**: Professional, includes links
   - Name
   - UW MSIM Candidate 2026
   - LinkedIn profile
   - Email

**Tone**:
- Professional but not stiff
- Confident but not arrogant
- Collaborative, not transactional
- Respectful of their time

**Length**:
- Tier 1 (Executives): Under 150 words
- Tier 2 (Researchers): 150-250 words OK
- Tier 3: 100-200 words

---

### Call Etiquette

**Before Call**:
- ✅ Send calendar invite with Zoom/Teams link
- ✅ Send agenda 48 hours ahead
- ✅ Test tech (camera, mic, internet)
- ✅ Prepare 5-7 questions (but stay flexible)

**During Call**:
- ✅ Start on time (join 2 min early)
- ✅ Thank them for their time (first 30 seconds)
- ✅ Stick to agenda (respect 30-min limit)
- ✅ Take notes (designate note-taker if multiple team members)
- ✅ Ask permission before recording
- ✅ End 2-3 minutes early (let them go)

**After Call**:
- ✅ Send thank-you email within 24 hours
- ✅ Summarize key takeaways and action items
- ✅ Follow through on commitments
- ✅ Keep them updated on progress

### Cultural Considerations

**European Stakeholders** (Most SAP AI team):
- More formal than US (use titles: Dr., Professor)
- Longer email response times acceptable (7-10 days)
- Work-life balance respected (don't email late nights/weekends)
- Academic titles matter (emphasize "Dr." if they have PhD)

**US Stakeholders** (Walter Sun):
- Faster pace expected
- First-name basis quickly
- Concise communication valued
- Entrepreneurial mindset (value scrappy, fast execution)
