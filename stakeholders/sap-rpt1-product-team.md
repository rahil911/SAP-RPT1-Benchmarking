"UW Research: Benchmarking Tabular Foundation Models (incl. RPT-1 & TabPFN)"

**Key Message Points**:
- UW MSIM project on tabular foundation models
- Interested in comparing RPT-1 and TabPFN approaches
- Publication-quality benchmarking study
- Would cite SAP research (RPT-1, TabPFN)
- Request: 30-min discussion on tabular model evaluation

**Ideal Ask**:
- 30-minute technical discussion on tabular foundation models
- Guidance on evaluating TabPFN vs. other approaches
- Feedback on benchmarking methodology
- Insights on in-context learning for relational data

**What NOT to Do**:
- Don't ignore TabPFN work (mention both TabPFN and RPT-1)
- Don't request proprietary model details
- Don't position as competitive evaluation (collaborative research)

**Follow-Up Strategy**:
- If no response in 7 days: Follow up via LinkedIn
- If still no response: Continue with other contacts
- If positive: Request technical details and evaluation guidance

**Timing Recommendation**:
- **Best Day**: Tuesday-Thursday
- **Best Time**: European afternoon (8-10 AM Pacific)

### Intelligence Summary

**Strengths as Contact**:
- ✅ High citation count (2,000+)
- ✅ TabPFN expertise (state-of-the-art work)
- ✅ Co-author on RPT-1
- ✅ Active researcher (NeurIPS acceptances)
- ✅ LinkedIn active (shares research)

**Potential Barriers**:
- ⚠️ May be focused on TabPFN rather than RPT-1
- ⚠️ Data Scientist level (not senior leadership)
- ⚠️ May defer to more senior researchers

**Mitigation**:
- Frame as tabular foundation model research broadly
- Include TabPFN in benchmarking scope
- Emphasize research collaboration, not just RPT-1

**Overall Assessment**: **SUPPORTING TECHNICAL CONTACT** - Strong research background, tabular expertise, active in community. Good for technical discussion and methodology feedback.

**Optimal Approach**: Position as comprehensive tabular foundation model benchmarking (RPT-1, TabPFN, others). Emphasize research rigor and citation of SAP work.
