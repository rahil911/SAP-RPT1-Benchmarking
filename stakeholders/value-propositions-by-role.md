- Early findings by Week 12 (Feb 2026) for interim feedback

### 3. Independent & Credible
- University of Washington (top-tier school) = unbiased
- Not vendor-sponsored, not consulting firm
- Academic rigor and publication standards

### 4. Mutual Benefit, Not One-Sided Ask
- SAP gets: Validation, insights, publicity
- We get: Access, guidance, real-world impact
- Win-win collaboration, not favor

### 5. Risk-Mitigated Approach
- Using publicly available sap-rpt-1-oss model (no NDA needed)
- Share findings pre-publication for feedback
- Collaborative disclosure of results
