3. **Talent**: Collaboration attracts top PhD candidates
4. **Benchmarking**: Independent performance validation vs. competitors

**What They Fear**:
- Negative benchmarks showing competitors outperform RPT-1
- Academic research exposing limitations or overstated claims
- Loss of narrative control to critics

**What They Want**:
- Rigorous, fair evaluation that showcases strengths
- Identification of optimal use cases
- Constructive feedback for product roadmap
- Citation in academic literature

---

### 8.2 Organizational Readiness for Collaboration

**Positive Indicators**:

**Potential Barriers**:
- ⚠️ Legal approval for data sharing (enterprise data privacy)
- ⚠️ Product launch timing (Nov 2025 = sensitive period)
- ⚠️ Competitive intelligence concerns
- ⚠️ Resource constraints (researchers focused on product development)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Frame as "independent benchmarking" not "product evaluation"
- Emphasize publication quality and academic rigor
- Offer to share draft findings pre-publication
- Focus on publicly available model (sap-rpt-1-oss) to avoid NDA requirements
